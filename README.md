### **Project Name:**

**Non-Human Governance (NHG)**

---

## **README**

### 1. What Problem Are We Tackling?

Current AI systems—especially large-scale, autonomous, or self-improving models—operate without a shared, transparent framework for public oversight.\*\*

* **Fragmented ethics efforts:** Guidelines exist, but they are scattered and often proprietary.
* **Rapid capability growth:** Model capabilities outpace the speed at which policy and governance are formed.
* **Public trust gap:** Users, regulators, and even practitioners lack clear, verifiable insight into how critical AI systems are built, deployed, and audited.

### **2. Purpose of This Repository**

This repo is an *open invitation* to collectively explore, debate, and prototype **governance mechanisms for “non-human” (autonomous) intelligence**. Instead of prescribing answers, we will:

1. **Map the landscape** — document existing governance proposals, oversight models, and ethical frameworks.
2. **Identify gaps** — highlight where current approaches fall short in clarity, enforceability, or inclusivity.
3. **Prototype ideas** — create lightweight specs, tooling, or reference processes that others can test and iterate on.
4. **Convene a community** — gather diverse voices (researchers, engineers, ethicists, policymakers, end-users) to debate, refine, and publish findings.

### **3. Why “Non-Human Governance”?**

The **nonhumangovernance.com** and **nonhumangovernance.org** domains will serve as permanent, neutral hubs for this work. “Non-human governance” underscores that we are governing systems whose decision-making is increasingly autonomous and opaque—distinct from traditional software or purely human institutions.

### **4. How You Can Collaborate**

| Action                   | Details                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Discuss & brainstorm** | Open an Issue or join Discussions to pose questions, critique ideas, or share resources.                                                            |
| **Contribute research**  | Submit papers, summaries, or landscape reviews via Pull Request under `/research`.                                                                  |
| **Propose frameworks**   | Draft governance models, checklists, or protocols in `/proposals`; each PR should state rationale and open questions.                               |
| **Build tooling**        | Add scripts or starter code that help test transparency, auditability, or accountability concepts (e.g., model cards, dataset lineage visualizers). |

### **5. Repository Structure (initial)**

```
/research      ↳ literature reviews, case studies  
/proposals     ↳ draft governance frameworks & specs  
/tooling       ↳ code or notebooks that operationalize proposals  
/docs          ↳ project charters, meeting notes, community guidelines  
```

### **6. Getting Started**

1. **Fork** → **Clone** → create a feature branch.
2. Keep each PR *small* and *focused* (one proposal, one tool, or one doc update).
3. Follow the Contributor Guide in `/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` (or create it if you’re first!).

### **7. Call for a Shared Mission Statement**

The current README intentionally frames only the *problem* and the *exploration mandate*.

* **Open task:** Draft a concise mission statement (≤ 3 sentences) that captures our collective goals.
* Submit your version as a PR to `/docs/mission.md`. We will iterate together until consensus.
