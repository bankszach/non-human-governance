# Tooling Directory

This directory contains code, scripts, notebooks, and tools that operationalize governance concepts for non-human intelligence systems.

## What Goes Here

- **Transparency Tools**: Scripts for generating model cards, dataset lineage visualizers
- **Audit Tools**: Code for automated governance checks and compliance monitoring
- **Accountability Tools**: Frameworks for tracking decision-making processes
- **Analysis Scripts**: Data processing and visualization tools for governance research
- **Prototype Implementations**: Working examples of proposed governance mechanisms

## Focus Areas

### Transparency
- Model card generators
- Dataset documentation tools
