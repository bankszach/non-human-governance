| **Core Idea**               | *“Governance for intelligence beyond our own.”* NHG positions itself as the neutral, open-source commons for shaping how autonomous AI is overseen.                                                                                                |
| **Tagline**                 | **“Stewarding Intelligence, Together.”**                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Brand Personality**       | **Scholarly + Inviting** — authoritative enough for policymakers and researchers, yet accessible to makers and the public.                                                                                                                         |
| **Tone of Voice**           | • Clear, plain-language explanations<br>• Optimistic but sober about risk<br>• Collaborative (“we”, “our community”) rather than paternalistic                                                                                                     |

| **Logo Concept**            | Stylized Möbius-loop made of intersecting “nodes” → conveys continuous oversight & collaboration. Variant with “NHG” monogram fits favicons/social avatars.                                                                                        |
