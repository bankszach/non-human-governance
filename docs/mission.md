# Mission Statement

*This is a draft mission statement. Please submit your version as a PR to iterate together until consensus.*

## Current Draft

**Non-Human Governance (NHG) exists to establish transparent, inclusive, and enforceable governance frameworks for autonomous AI systems that benefit all of humanity.**

We believe that as AI systems become increasingly autonomous and opaque in their decision-making, we need collective, open-source approaches to governance that can evolve as rapidly as the technology itself.

Our mission is to convene diverse stakeholders—researchers, engineers, ethicists, policymakers, and end-users—to collaboratively design, test, and implement governance mechanisms that ensure AI systems remain accountable, transparent, and aligned with human values.

## Open Questions for Community Discussion

1. How should we balance innovation with safety in our governance proposals?
2. What role should different stakeholders play in the governance process?
3. How do we ensure our frameworks are both principled and practical?
4. What metrics should we use to evaluate the effectiveness of governance mechanisms?
